# Rotten-potato

## A Korean film and drama rating website.

There are a bunch of well known websites for rating movies and series. I created this project
for rating solely Korean dramas and movies.the title "Rotten-Potato" has been chosen to remind peaple of "Rotten-Tomato",
the American review-aggregation website for film and television.

### Used technologies:

For the base structure of this website I used create-react-app using the command
"npx create-react-app rotten-potato".this project may seem as an amatuer clone of as mentioned
"Rotten Tomato" but I try to change the base and add new features. testing is also a very important
part of this project so I connected my code to "codecov" using Github actions. this project consists
of react,javascript,html,css code.
